# Progress Bar Component Documentation

## Overview

A customizable React progress bar component that displays numbered steps with animations, built using Chakra UI and Lottie animations. The component shows the current progress with animated success indicators and directional arrows between steps.

## Dependencies

npm install @chakra-ui/react react-icons lottie-react

## Component Structure

### Core Elements

1. Main Container

- Uses Chakra UI's `Flex` component
- Direction is forced to LTR (left-to-right)
- Accepts spread props for additional customization
- Maintains gaps between elements

2. Step Indicators

- Generated dynamically based on `steps` prop
- Each step consists of:
  - Circular button with number
  - Success animation (when completed)
  - Arrow connector (except for last step)

3. Visual Elements

- Success Animation: Uses Lottie animation
- Arrows: Uses `BsArrowRight` from react-icons
- Numbers: Displayed when step is not completed
- Tooltips: Shows ordinal numbers (1st, 2nd, etc.)

### Props Interface

interface ProgressBarProps {
steps: number; // Total number of steps
colortheme?: string; // Color theme for the component
size?: string; // Size of the buttons
current: number; // Current active step
[x: string]: any; // Additional props spread
}

### Styling Details

Button States:

- Completed steps: Green color scheme
- Future steps: Gray color scheme
- Current step: Solid variant
- Upcoming steps: Outline variant

Animations:

- Success animation plays when step is completed
- 0.3s transition for smooth state changes

## Usage Example

import { ProgressBar } from './ProgressBar';

function MyComponent() {
return (
<ProgressBar
     steps={5}
     current={3}
     size="md"
     colortheme="blue"
   />
);
}

## Component Implementation Details

### Step Generation

- Uses `Array.from()` to create array based on steps count
- Maps through array to generate step components
- Each step is wrapped in a Flex container for alignment

### Step States

1. Completed Steps (index + 1 < current)

- Shows success animation
- Green color scheme
- Solid variant

2. Current Step (index + 1 === current)

- Shows number
- Solid variant
- Active state styling

3. Future Steps (index + 1 > current)

- Shows number
- Gray color scheme
- Outline variant

### Interactive Elements

Tooltips:

- Show ordinal numbers using numberToOrdinal utility
- Appear on hover over step buttons
- Provide additional context for each step

Arrow Connectors:

- Placed between steps using BsArrowRight
- Visually connect steps to show progression
- Excluded after the final step

Key Features:

- Dynamic step generation based on props
- Animated success indicators using Lottie
- Responsive design with Chakra UI components
- Tooltip guidance for better UX
- Customizable through props
- Clear visual progression with arrows
- Smooth state transitions
- Accessibility support through Chakra UI
